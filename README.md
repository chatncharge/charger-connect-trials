# Charger Connect Trials

## Process
- Dev pushes test code **AND BINARY**
- Ops pulls repo and runs

## Notes
- Class files are NOT ignored!
  Reasons:
  - To avoid compilation on target machines.
  - To avoid artifact handling.
  As soon as we have code that requires a build system, we will switch from class files to jar files and ignore class files.
